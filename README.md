# Costerl

## About
:money_with_wings: Costerl is a React Native app that lets you keep track of your expenses and use the visualisation tool to see how and when you spend your money. 

:hammer: In this particular fork we have not added any additional features, but have started a conversion to TypeScript, added unit tests with Jest and Testing Library to certain parts of the application and used the MSW library to mock API calls to the backend.
